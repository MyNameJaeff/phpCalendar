# phpCalendar
This was a task given to me during year 4 at NTI Södertörn, the idea was to make a calendar for each month by using php, javascript, css and html.

## Requirements
One page where there was to be a calendar that displayed current year and month that had each days "namnsdag", week number, day number and if its a sunday. The calendar also had an image per month displayed next to the current months name.
There was also the need to make another page where it would display an input box where the user could select a date and the website would check how many days there were untill the next friday, and if it was friday a special page were to be displayed.
